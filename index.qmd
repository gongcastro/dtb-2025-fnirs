# What is fNIRS?

Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy

## The rationale behind fNIRS

- Some materials, have different optical properties than others (e.g., they absorbe light of different colors)

[ADD LIGHT WAVELENGHTS]

- We can study the composition of an object by analysing how light behaves when passing through it (i.g., **spectroscopy**)

[ADD DIAGRAM ABOUT ABSORTION AND SCATTERING]

- Oxy-haemoglobin (HbO) and deoxy-haemoglobin (HbR) have absorb **near-infrared light** differently

- If we shine near-infrared light into biological tissue, we can estimate changes in relative concentration of HbO and HbR time (**functional**)

[ADD MLLB EQUATION]

- In brain tissue, neuronal activity is followed by BOLD response. Using fNIRS, we can measure BOLD signal as a proxy of brain activity in an area.

## Desiging an fNIRS experiments

- Low temporal resolution: the BOLD response takes time! (~15 seconds)
- Two main types of experimental designs:
  a) Block design
