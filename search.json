    "text": "The rationale behind fNIRS\n\nSome materials, have different optical properties than others (e.g., they absorbe light of different colors)\n\n[ADD LIGHT WAVELENGHTS]\n\nWe can study the composition of an object by analysing how light behaves when passing through it (i.g., spectroscopy)\n\n[ADD DIAGRAM ABOUT ABSORTION AND SCATTERING]\n\nOxy-haemoglobin (HbO) and deoxy-haemoglobin (HbR) have absorb near-infrared light differently\nIf we shine near-infrared light into biological tissue, we can estimate changes in relative concentration of HbO and HbR time (functional)\n\n[ADD MLLB EQUATION]\n\nIn brain tissue, neuronal activity is followed by BOLD response. Using fNIRS, we can measure BOLD signal as a proxy of brain activity in an area."
